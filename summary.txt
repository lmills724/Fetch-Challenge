Assignment #2

1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
The tools and libraries that I used in this challenge include the csv, sys, json, datetime, and defaultdict.
 - csv library allowed me to parse the the csv file easier and read in the data as dictionaries, which makes code easier to follow when indexing.
 - sys library was helpful for taking in the command line arguments.
 - json library was useful for formatting the output correctly.
 - datetime library allowed me to read in the timestamps and find the oldest transactions in just two lines of code.
 - defaultdict library was helpful in formatting the output correctly

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
    Advantages: My solution is organized and runs pretty quickly. I put lots of comments along my code and also divided my code into seperate functions, which
    makes it easier to test/troubleshoot.
    Disadvantages: My solution is likely longer than it could be, my redeemPoints function is pretty lengthy. Also, my code seems pretty fast, but looking back I'm sure
    there are ways to optimize it further.

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
    One of my favorite school projects recently was Probabilistic Language Identification. This project was for my artificial intelligence course and we used Bayes rule
    to compute the probability that the observed evidence was written in English or Spanish. This project challenged me by testing my computational efficiency as well as my
    knowledge of programming complex probability models. Overall, I found this project to be challenging but incredibly valuable and fun!
